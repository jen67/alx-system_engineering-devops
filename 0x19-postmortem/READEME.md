# 🚨 Postmortem: SSH Key Authentication Fiasco 🚨

## Issue Summary
- **Duration of Outage:** August 14, 2024, 2:30 PM - 4:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** I was locked out of the Ubuntu web terminal due to an SSH key authentication failure. My attempts to manage server configurations and deploy updates were thwarted, causing a minor panic and a delay in project progress. It’s like forgetting the password to your own house — but digital.
- **Root Cause:** An unforgiving mix of incorrect SSH key permissions and a mismatch between the key format on my local machine and what the server was expecting. It was like trying to use a key made for a Swiss watch on a regular door lock.

## Timeline
- **2:30 PM:** Attempted to SSH into the server, only to be greeted by the dreaded “Access Denied” message. My heart sank.
- **2:35 PM:** I rebooted everything in sight, hoping for a miracle. Spoiler alert: miracles didn’t happen.
- **2:45 PM:** Realized the private key permissions were too open. It was basically saying, “Hey, everyone can use this key!” — not ideal for security.
- **3:00 PM:** Tried regenerating and re-adding the key. It felt like giving the key a fresh coat of paint and hoping it would work better.
- **3:15 PM:** Discovered the key format was like mismatched puzzle pieces. Adjusted the format to match the server’s expectations.
- **3:30 PM:** Key permissions corrected and format fixed. Finally managed to authenticate and access the server. Victory!

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause:** The SSH key issue boiled down to a permissions blunder and a format mismatch. It was a classic case of “Whoops, didn’t read the manual!”
- **Resolution:** Corrected the key permissions to `600` (because `666` is never a good idea) and adjusted the key format to align with the server’s expectations. It’s like finding the right key for the right lock, and ensuring it doesn’t get stuck.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regularly check and update SSH key permissions. Think of it as a security check-up, but for your digital keys.
  - Make sure key formats are compatible with servers. Imagine making sure your house key fits before you lock yourself out.
  - Automate key validation. Use scripts to verify that keys are properly configured — less manual checking, more peace of mind.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. **Patch Key Permissions:** Adjust key file permissions to `600` to avoid unwanted access.
  2. **Verify Key Format:** Ensure the SSH key format is compatible with server requirements.
  3. **Automate Key Checks:** Implement scripts to check key permissions and formats.
  4. **Update Documentation:** Revise procedures for SSH key management to include best practices.

Remember, even when you’re locked out, it’s all part of the learning curve. Next time, we’ll have the right key — and a better story to tell!
